# ISTDS Project 5: Fake Review Detection

**What I used:**
- **NLP:** NLTK, TF-IDF, Text Analysis  
- **Model:** `LogisticRegression`  
- **Data Sources:** `Kaggle` and `Web Scraping`
# How Works?
This application determines whether a review is **fake or real** by following these steps:

- **Text Cleaning**: Reviews are cleaned and standardized  
- **Feature Extraction**: Features like TF-IDF, text length, and punctuation marks are extracted  
- **Machine Learning**: A trained model is used to make predictions
- **Result**: The app shows whether the review is fake/real along with a confidence score
